1980,Good Intentions 2018 Frankie Cabernet Franc (Mount Gambier),Christina Pickard,"From a tiny, high altitude region near the border of Victoria, this naturally made Cab Franc is complex yet highly drinkable without a lick of funk. Black cherry-hued, it opens with notes of black olive, licorice, dark chocolate, damp earth and wild bramble berries. There's some power in the mouth but an ease, too, as though comfortable in its own skin, unforced by winemaking trickery; a flow of juicy brambly fruit, crystalline acidity, sinewy tannins and a mineral, sanguine note toward the finish. Drink now with wintery fare.",92,$30,Frankie,Cabernet Franc,"Mount Gambier, South Australia, Australia",Good Intentions,12.3%,750 ml,Red,4/1/2020,Not rated yet [Add Your Review],Little Peacock Imports,
